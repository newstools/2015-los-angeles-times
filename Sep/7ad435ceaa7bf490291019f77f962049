Pickups at John Wayne Airport (SNA) just got a little easier. The Orange County airport has opened a cellphone parking lot near the corner of MacArthur Boulevard and Campus Drive where drivers can cool their heels. The airport officially opened the lot Tuesday morning, which should help ease parking and traffic inside the airport.
