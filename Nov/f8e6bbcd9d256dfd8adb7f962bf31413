Getting up close with a shark is the stuff of nightmares anywhere, but in Hawaii, it’s not only possible, it’s painless. An Oahu aquarium is providing more opportunities for hands-on encounters with sea creatures, sharks included. Sea Life Park Hawaii in Waimanalo will unveil its expanded touch-pools attraction Saturday, allowing visitors to get face to fin with marine life. The new addition to the popular pools will showcase baby sharks and young Hawaiian rays. Educators known as aquarists will teach the importance of conservation as their guests interact with the creatures. In another pool, guests can touch honu, baby Hawaiian sea turtles, during hatchling season. Other animals on display include crabs, octopuses and sea cucumbers. All the marine life is native to Hawaiian waters and tide pools. The Saturday grand opening will include live entertainment and special exhibits. On that day, one child under 12 will be admitted free with a paying adult. Sea Life, a 30- to 40-minute drive from Waikiki, is open 10:30 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.  Tickets cost $29.99 for adults and $19.99 for children ages 3-12. Info: Sea Life Park (808) 259-2500 ALSO Uber, schmuber. Behold the buses of Pago Pago...
