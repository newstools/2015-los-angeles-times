Known as “America’s Sweethearts of Song,” The Lennon Sisters will perform their timeless hits at the Suncoast Showroom June 6-7. Sisters Janet, Kathy and Mimi Lennon, who appear at the Suncoast, celebrate a 55-year career that started when a high school classmate, Larry Welk, booked them on “The Lawrence Welk Show.” For 13 years, the quartet were regulars on the show until departing in 1968. Sisters Dianne and Peggy moved in and out of the group over the years. Their first album, “Let’s Get Acquainted,” debuted in 1957, and their early singles, “Tonight, You Belong to Me” and “Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)” were Billboard chart hits. Their subsequent albums, including “The Lennon Sisters Sing Twelve Great Hits,” “On the Groovy Side” and “The Lennon Sisters Today,” produced turntable favorites such as “This Is My Song, Till” and “I’m Coming Back to You.” On television, they made hundreds of guest appearances on “The Mickey Mouse Club,” “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “The Hollywood Palace,” “Perry Como’s Kraft Music Hall,” “The Jackie Gleason Show,” “The Tonight Show” and “The Cher Show.” At the height of their popularity, the sisters had merchandising tie-ins such as paper dolls, TV trays and coloring books. They even sang for seven presidents including Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan. In 2001, The Lennon Sisters were formally inducted into the National Vocal Group Hall of Fame joining groups such as The Eagles, Bee Gees, The Pied Pipers, Gladys Knight & the Pips and The Chordettes. The Lennon Sisters are the inspiration for questions on television game shows including “Jeopardy” and “Family Feud” as well as the board game Trivial Pursuit. Recently, “Saturday Night Live” featured a recurring skit spoofing “The Lawrence Welk Show” and The Lennon Sisters starring comedian Kristen Wiig. Tickets are $29.95.
