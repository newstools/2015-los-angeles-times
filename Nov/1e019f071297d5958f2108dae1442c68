Las Vegas is pretty much a Cirque du Soleil kind of town. The Canadian-based circus art troupe juggles eight shows at hotels along the Strip. Now comes a holiday deal that could mean enjoying more than one Cirque show on your next trip to Vegas. It’s pretty simple: Buy a ticket to a Cirque show and purchase a second ticket for $15. The deal: The deal applies to “Ka” at the MGM Grand, “Mystere” at Treasure Island, “Zumanity” at New York-New York, “Zarkana” at the Aria, “The Beatles Love” at the Mirage and “Criss Angel Believe” at Luxor. In a separate deal, you can receive 15% off tickets to the two remaining shows, “O” at the Bellagio and “Michael Jackson One” at Mandalay Bay. When: The offers are good for shows until Dec. 17, based on availability. Some blackout dates apply between Nov. 26 and 29. Tested: Tickets for Cirque du Soleil shows range from $59 to $79. I checked availability for this Saturday night and found tickets to see “Ka” for $63 each (the second one would cost $15). When you buy tickets online, you are billed for the full price of $124. Don’t panic; the discount is applied at the end of the transaction.
