Established in 1872, Yellowstone is the nation’s oldest national park and one of the most visited. It’s known for its geysers and hot springs. Indeed, Yellowstone contains 60% of the world’s geysers, including Old Faithful, its most famous, and the Grand Prismatic Hot Spring, America’s largest hot spring. The park also houses a rich collection of historical artifacts in its museum, library and research centers. In this series of photos, Los Angeles Times photographer Anne Cusack captures the colors and textures of Yellowstone in the late summer. For more photos, visit The Times’ photography page.
