Spooky times are headed to Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition at the Luxor when the Haunted Ghost Tours return every Saturday in October at 8 p.m. Don’t worry; this exhibit is good for the whole family, taking guests on a tour of the remains of the “unsinkable” ship that hit an iceberg on April 15, 1912, and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean on her maiden voyage. During the ghost tour, meet some of the passengers on the RMS Titanic and hear stories of the exhibition staff’s ghostly encounters. The exhibit features more than 300 artifacts rescued from the bottom of the Atlantic, and some of the employees and guests there have wondered if the spirits of former passengers returned to find their possessions. One tale tells the story of the “Lady in Black,” often seen on the Grand Staircase crying for her famous friend, Margaret Brown. The Titanic’s lookout, Frederick Fleet, has been spotted watching over the exhibition’s Promenade Deck, trying to right his late sighting of the iceberg. Another passenger predicted the sinking of the “Ship of Dreams” when he wrote to a friend a few days before he perished in the North Atlantic. “Right now I wish the ‘Titanic’ were lying at the bottom of the ocean,” he wrote. Head over to the Haunted Ghost Tours on Saturdays at 8 p.m. all October.  Tickets, which include the ghost tour, go for $32 for adults, $30 for seniors and $24 for children 4-12 years of age.
